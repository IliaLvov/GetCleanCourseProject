Codebook for the Tidy Dataset
=
This markdown file presents the codebook for the tidy dataset that is submitted for this assignment to the Coursera website.
Such dataset can be derived by running the run_analysis.R script that can be found in this repository.
This codebook suggests explicitely references to data description textfiles of the original raw data.
You can find the original raw data [here] (https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip).
Please refer to the following files for the raw data description:

- README.txt
- feautures_info.txt

This codebook explains only data transformations performed on top of the original dataset as it was.
It is inspired by [Kirstin's Sample Codebook](https://class.coursera.org/getdata-008/forum/thread?thread_id=34).
